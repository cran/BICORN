Description: Prior transcription factor binding knowledge and target gene expression data are integrated in a Bayesian framework for functional cis-regulatory module inference. Using Gibbs sampling, we iteratively estimate transcription factor associations for each gene, regulation strength for each binding event and the hidden activity for each transcription factor.
